title: About Me
---

I am a Senior DevOps Engineer with 8+ years of experience building, automating, and operating cloud-native platforms at enterprise scale. I specialize in Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, and operational automation, with a strong focus on reliability and simplicity.

My career reflects a steady transition from maintaining pipelines and infrastructure to owning platform-level solutions that reduce operational overhead and enable teams to ship with confidence.

> 🧭 I focus on building systems that are easy to run, scale, and evolve.

## How I Work

I believe DevOps is about discipline, ownership, and long-term thinking — not just tools. I prioritize automation, clear boundaries, and maintainable solutions over short-term fixes.

I care deeply about developer experience, operational stability, and systems that teams can trust.

## What I’m Not

- ❌ A “click-ops” engineer who relies on manual changes
- ❌ Focused on tools without understanding the system behind them
- ❌ Interested in fragile, over-engineered solutions
- ❌ Detached from operations after deployment

> 🎯 Reliability is a design choice, not an afterthought.
